This project implements a travel agency system with classes for Airports, Hotels, Rooms, Reservations, and Customers. Users can create reservations for flights, hotels, and bed-and-breakfast stays, manage bookings in a Basket, and complete purchases with a Customer account. All functionality follows strict implementation rules, including proper reservation validation and cost calculations.
